# Weave

> [!ALERT]
> I'm leaving it in a partially broken state because I want to test some funcionality

This is **Weave**, a text "editor" inspired by [Plan9's Acme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_(text_editor)).

Below you can see an example of things you might do with it.

If you need a command, just write it.
Need to bold a piece of text? Just type **bold** or **b** and double-click on the word.
It will become your bold button.

> [!CAUTION]
> I have made many changes recently so the documentation below on how to use it and capabilities is outdated. I will update it
> once I have stabilised functionality.

Ideally the whole editor would live in a bookmarklet, as a `data:text/html` URI. But that is not cross-browser compatible for saving (Chrome and Edge don't allow it), so the best is that you use it from GitHub pages‚Ä¶ or **just `git clone` and open the HTML locally as a file**. That seems to work fine in Chrome and Safari, just drag the HTML file to them. Data is stored as URL anchors, so technically it could be read from some log in GitHub. The inspiration for this was [here](https://mostlymaths.net/2020/10/202058-readings.html/#worlds-smallest-office-suitehttpszsergecompostsawfice).

### <a name='Roughareas'></a>Rough areas
- Creating lists by writing a dash and a space in a new line works, but can behave somewhat weirdly.
- Font size and width are stored in pixels, which can be a pain if the window is resized (particularly width).
- Print preview looks bad, but when printing it actually works. It also prints the "buttons". I'm still unsure if I want to fix this.

### <a name='Plannedfeatures'></a>Planned features?
- [x] ~~Creating headings by typing hashes at the beginning of the line.~~
- [ ] Checkboxes.
- [ ] Code cleanup, there is a lot of repetition (particularly in how I handle and rewrite selection ranges).
- [ ] Code cleanup, make it easier to reason about and extend, since I'm using it pretty regularly.
- [x] ~~Inject the fonts so there is no need to pull the CSSs for mono and serif.~~

### <a name='Name'></a>Name?

This used to be named Om, short for _Omni_. Acme (corp and the editor too) do many things.

After adding a bunch of features I started to not like the name that much, and changed it to
_Weave_, because it lets you weave evaluated code with normal text, a bit like `weave` from
Knuth's Literate Programming tool.

### <a name='Why'></a>Why?

Useful to take somewhat transient and local notes, without needing a text editor of any kind.
